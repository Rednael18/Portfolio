# Chess AI

My first major project, soon after picking up Python. This script lets the user play a game of chess with an AI opponent,
which at a search-depth of 4 has an ELO rating of roughly 800. 

There is much I would have revised if I were to redo this project today (January 2023), including:
- More efficient storage of gamestate (perhaps using bitboards)
- More implementations of classes
- Better training of the neural network
- Better documentation
